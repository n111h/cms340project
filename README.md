## /deliverables

A directory holding the documents/assignments requested by Dr. Elva.  Currently contains Requirements Engineering Document (.docx, and .pdf).

### /deliverables/oldStatisticsProject

A directory holding documents/assignments submitted as part of the old satastics project.

## /documentation

A directory to hold project documents for analysis.  Currently contains use case diagrams.

### /documentation/oldStatisticsProject

A directory holding the old statistics project interview questions, and the final report from the last group (no security concerns).

## Narative

Students in CMS 120 have come to tutoring sessions with several consistent issues.  For instance, students write algorithms with incorrect data types for the variables they use.  This type of issue comes from how Python is formatted (not making programmers declare data types on assignment/declaration) and obfuscates details from programmers.  Although the format of Python is oriented towards making programming easier, beginners do not inherently learn necessary concepts because the language covers up many aspects of programming complexity for the sake of ease of use. 
Because CMS 120 is an introductory course, students are not expected to have prior knowledge of these concepts, however, it is good practice to teach students to code defensively and understand how the code they have written works.  Since CMS 120 students are beginners coding in python – which allows them to program with more freedom than many other high-level languages – they may face more difficulty when they reach upper level CS classes if they never have a chance to develop a proper understanding of key programming concepts.  This emphasizes the importance of having beginner students learn effective coding practices early on.
To combat this problem, there is a need for a web application that can read through student code snippets, give feedback, and ask questions.  The program will not format the code for students, but it will ask related questions and challenge them to further their understanding of python.  This would be a comprehensive way for CMS 120 students to exercise and reflect on their understanding of good coding practice taught in class while they are programming.

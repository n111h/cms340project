the structure of the Qeustion component: Function Generate Questions. 

    Input: a two dimensional list
    
        Objective of generate question, create a question
        There are syntax question, data type quetion and generic quesiton
        
        1. first thing we can do is to check the current questions we have.
        2. we can iterate through the two dimensional list and check for number of spaces
            Flag a indentation boolean if...
                a. the number of space is not multiple of 4,
                b. the number of space is multiple of 4 but, the number of space does not match with the next line and 
                   the previous line although the last character is not : 
                   
        3. if we see the flag for the syntax question then create a syntax question. with id 10 question about the indentation
            (this can be done before any loop)
            
            ** also having a list of keyword that we want to be paying attention might be a good idea.
            keyword = ["'", "if", "else", "def"] 
            matching of parenthesis to figure out if we need another syntax question. 
        4. let's iterate throught the two dimensional list one by one. 
            
            processing the row. 
            
            1. we want to catch the assignment of values (iData Type) question
                so we want to have a catch in = but make sure in the condition that it is actually the assignment by looking at the previous and the next 
                
                if type of the value was list, we could generate more questions on list
            
            2. if the current element that we are looking at is in the list of keyword then create syntax questions
            
            3. Generic is kindo of like a fun trivia quesiton so create the question at least one.
